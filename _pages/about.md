As a computational cognitive scientist with a background in physics and education in computational neuroscience, my research delves into the fascinating realm of human pattern learning, the acquisition of abstract concepts, and the extraction of meaningful relations from perceptual sequences. With a passion for understanding both artificial and biological neural activities, my goal is to contribute to the advancement of AI safety while empowering our ability to unravel the intricacies of the human brain and behavior. By bridging the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, I aim to drive innovation and make significant strides toward unlocking the full potential of intelligent systems.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
